## Work experience

### SDE Intern at Amazon (May - August 2021)

I was an SDE intern at Amazon Madrid for 14 weeks where I worked on Vegas, part of the INtech organisation.
Had to migrate an internal tool which automated reports using several internal tools to Amazon Web Services. I was given the opportunity to:
* write a design document the "Amazon way" examining every possible option for the project with the respective pros/cons, making an implementation plan, a proposal for the migration and many more things.
* build the infrastructure of the app using CDK.
* learn how to do unit testing exhaustively and write the tests for the project.
* learn how different AWS services such as Lambda, S3, IAM (roles/users/policies), Cloudwatch, Route 53, VPC... work and use them.
* become the owner of the project and decide by myself (with data to support my decisions, of course)

## Skills

* Java, Python and Typescript coder. 🐍
* HTML & CSS3.
* Some experience with C++ and C.
* AWS, DynamoDB, Flask.


## Fun facts
